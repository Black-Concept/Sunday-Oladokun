# Hi there,
My name is Sunday Oladokun, a data scientist based in Abuja.
After spending over 3 years in visual and UI design, I decided to transition in the world of data science late 2023.
I have since then moved from being just a student of this field to be a student leader as I currently serve as the
president of school of data, Altschool Africa where I am currently pursuing a diploma in data science.
